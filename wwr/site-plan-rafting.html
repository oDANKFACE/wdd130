    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to expand our business from a local home-town/billboard tourist attraction,
    and give it an online presence that modernizes our services. Booking tours, getting directions, meeting the crew,
    reading reviews, everything directed toward increasing our revenue and giving us a foothold in a space that has
    incredible advertising potential.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our customers are primarily middle class young adult outdoorsy types, and families seeking outdoor activities/tourist
        attractions. Their interests may include hiking, photography, rock climbing, thrill seeking, nature, and/or
        water sports. Their needs include medium to large group activities, activities that are proctored by another
        party, and getting in touch with nature.</p>

    instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes
    (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.
    You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours.
    Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->

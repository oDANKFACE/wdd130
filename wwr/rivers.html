      <p>This is the beautiful snake river. It gets its name from the ancient snake god, Tymuwaystid, who carved this
      river as he traveled across the continent. Bring your friends and family in reverence of the great snake, and ride
      the white water!</p>

      Dakota. Whenever you find yourself driving through Nevada, think about turning around and visiting us at the Ohio

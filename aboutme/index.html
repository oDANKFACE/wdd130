    <h2>Darien</h2>
    <h2>No Nickname</h2>
    <p>An undisclosed amount of time ago I was born in a place to parents who raised me.</p>
    <p>Like any person, I have a lot of things I enjoy and several things I don't. I love good stories and music. It
    follows that I dislike bad stories and music. I think critically about of media production, purpose, audience, and
        intensity.</p>
    <p>I love music in many capacities and settings. I enjoy a range of music from Anne-Sophie Mutter to Blink-182.
    I enjoy writing my own music and have aspirations to compose for a film one day. I've played in several bands in
    different capacities, and love playing live shows!</p>
    <p>I currently work in a corporate position, managing International Info Teams. My goal is to enter a career as a
    web developer.</p>

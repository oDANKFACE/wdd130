    Content
  </h2>
  <h3>Home page</h3>
  <p>
    Home Page
    One of the most important aspects of a product is how it is sold. I want my audience to feel compelled to engage and transact with my product. I will do this by presenting high points of the project and give them calls to action.
    Trailer Video
    I will want to display the trailer for the game front and center. This will be one of the first interactions a visitor will have with the site, and is something 18-35 year olds are very accustomed to.
    Game Aspects
    The site will showcase many facets of the game similar to those found in other popular games. Crafting, fighting, cooperative play, and much more. I will describe the way these mechanics are included in the product.
    Sign Up
    I will provide a button to entice visitors to sign up for the product. That could be for an email list, a beta list, or for the actual subscription. For now the sign up will be represented by just a button, but future functionality will allow them to enter their email address in a field, and perhaps even create an account.
    Sharing
    I will provide an easy way for visitors to share the site with their friends. After showcasing the selling points of the product, it will be natural for visitors to share it with their friends and on social media. For now this will be represented by a link to the appropriate site, as there is no content available to share at the moment.

  <h3>Gameplay</h3>
  <p>
    Gameplay
    The heart of the product is how it is played. I will describe in greater detail how the game is played through descriptions and images. This will be a topic of interest for visitors of the site.
    Crafting
    This is an aspect found in many other games. I will highlight the methods and put a spotlight on the rewarding aspects to entice engagement. The design here is to make visitors feel like they are already playing the game. When you watch a card game being played and you begin to understand how it works, you start to have fun! This feeling cannot be satisfied just by watching, however. In order to truly feel satisfied, you will need to participate.
    Lore/History
    Another attractive part of similar projects is the history and lore of the setting. I will use this opportunity to provide a creatively written narrative driven toward cliff hanging and wanting more through engaging with the site.
    Combat
    Similar games have combat, and fighting is a central critique for my audience. I will describe it through text and images in such a way that leaves no doubt in its fun. Dynamic photos with lots of leaning lines and a feeling of motion will be paramount. There is room on the site for the still, beautiful, and awe-inspiring images, but this page is dedicated to action.

  <h3>About Us</h3>
  <p>
    About Us
    A popular method of engagement is the humanizing of the project. Nothing can humanize a project better than meeting the actual humans behind the curtain! As users begin to learn who we are, a sort of introductory comradery is built, which only adds to the success of the sale.
    The Team
    This will be an opportunity to provide pictures and a bio for the team involved. Things they are interested in, their role in the company, and their photo. This allows the visitor to see that this is not simply a product that exists on the internet, it is something made by people, and in fact, a labor of love.
    Development Over Time
    Seeing a project develop over the course of years is thrilling. If you werenâ€™t there from the beginning, then the next best thing is to get the spark notes version. This will showcase the development over the game over the years.
    Contact
    Visitors often have questions or want to contact us in some way. We will provide a button for them to do so. For now, this will be represented by just a listed email address. Future development will involve a contact form that will detail the nature of the contact.
